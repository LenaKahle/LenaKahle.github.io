I want to share some of the coolest videos I watch, books I read, and anything else I come across, by making blog posts (at irregular intervals), as a sort of peer-to-peer addition to the usual algorithmic content suggestions. This is the first one, I hope you find something that inspires you!

If you have something you'd think I'd be interested in, I'd love to see it!

# Anna Howard - 'creating a digital garden to end my doomscrolling'

Anna Howard introduced me to the concept of a digital garden in this video, in which she deals with the question of how we can be more mindful in our consumption of online (and offline) content. A digital garden provides a place for ideas to grow and form connections to concepts you encounter in the content you consume - from university lectures, books, videos, conversations, reels, anything goes.

For me, this video was like a small rock that set off an avalanche of ideas and efforts, which so far hasn't stopped rolling. The video motivated me to start using Obsidian as my "Zettelkasten"/"Digital Garden"/"Commonplace Book" and so far, I am very happy with it. By making notes on videos I watch, books I read, and in general concepts that I encounter and ideas I have, and linking all of that together, I have noticed a surge in motivation to research topics and creative ideas. Additionally, it gives me the comfort that I can leave something for a while and pick back up where I left it whenever I feel like it thanks to my notes.

Another super cool feature of Obsidian is this graph view that visualises the connection between your notes and shows how your areas of interests intersect:

# Ambling with Sam - 'Islands in the Sky â€” How the Inca Farmed the Impossible'

After coming back from my trip to Peru, I was very interested in learning more about society in the Pre-Columbian Andes, with a focus on Inca mythology, culture, and textile making. After I started reading some textbook and watching a few dry videos, YouTube recommended this video, which is amazing: besides being very well made and entertaining to watch, it opened up a whole new world of concepts, some of which I had encountered briefly and others that were completely new to me. Each of the many topics mentioned seems super interesting and I want to look more deeply into them.

The huge amount of different ecosystems in Peru and Bolivia ranges from coast to desert to rainforest to mountain highlands - between 0m and 5000m, the Quechuan people lived and farmed and raised livestock. Not only did they develop amazing techniques for making these habitats agriculturally suitable like terraces (they even had areas dedicated to scientific experiments on farming techinques, like at Moray!), the people also shared their knowledge and goods across the altitudes, even before times of a centralised government.

While much of their culture and knowledge has been lost through the ignorance and oppression of the colonialisation, some of their inventions we still reference today. For example: with the cold, dry temperatures in the higher Andes mountains and the strong sun exposure, the Inca developed a technique of drying llama and alpaca meat and called it "Ch'arki" - this is where the modern word "jerkey" comes from!
