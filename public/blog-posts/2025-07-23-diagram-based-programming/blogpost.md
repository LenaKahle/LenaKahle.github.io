# Intuitive drawing and diagram-based agreements between human and machine as the future of programming

Communication between man and Turing machines is full of compromises, hindering humans from intuitively expressing their ideas to the machine. The restrictions imposed through the requirements of communicating in human-readable code are hindering the machine from choosing the most performant implementation. The code we write is at a fixed level of abstraction, meaning as much consideration is needed for the definition of critical components as for less important features.

I propose a different way of programming more aligned with human nature through
communicating ideas with AI in intuitive ways of speech and drawing and replacing line by line implementation of code by forming a natural language and diagram based contract between human and machine.

## Roadmap
Programming with schematic drawings is already possible today, though there are translation steps necessary between paper/whiteboard and compiler. By passing sketches to cursor, it already has the OCR capabilities to decipher handwriting and understand the drawings in such a way that it can discuss them with us and translate them to code. However, interesting discussions and learnings are often lost in the oblivion of the chat history if they are not directly implemented, as implementation remains tedious and time-consuming.

In the future, programming could happen in multimodal meetings with team members and AI agents in which ideas are expressed intuitively through free-form drawings of e.g. architecture and logic flow and descriptions of edge case scenarios. At the end of the session, the humans and AI agree upon a set of schematic drawings and representations of how the system must function. This serves as a "contract" which to which the AI must adhere when handling the implementation of the system in whatever way it deems most performant,
neither adding nor subtracting logic. These three phases - design, negotiation,
implementation - form the new workflow.

## Advantages
This design process allows humans to stay engaged and in control (and responsibility) of the systems they create, while allowing for a much smoother and more intuitive process. This can be contrasted to current models of humans having to approve AI written code, which is not just inefficient, but also leads to blindly accepting propositions of alpha-version models while losing awareness of the bigger picture.

It also provides a flexibility in the level of refinement. Critical areas can be defined in excruciating detail, while for other parts it might be sufficient to provide baseline examples for how the system should respond in certain scenarios. These can be communicated in natural language, through diagrams, voice, or any other form, before being made a part of the final schematic representation proposed by the AI.

I see this way of programming of a logical possible next step in the development of
programming. As computers have evolved, our way of communicating with them has become increasingly intuitive for us, from stencil cards to assembler code to modern day frameworks. With each new level of abstraction we lose awareness and control over the exact implementation details, while remaining able to trust the machine to correctly execute our instructions with whatever optimisations happen in the background.

On our way to such a future, this proposed model is backwards compatible: our current codebases already serve as the contracts between humans and machines. They can over time transform into such higher level schematic representations which are intuitive to humans to understand and develop.
