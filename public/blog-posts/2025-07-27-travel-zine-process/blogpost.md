# What is a zine?
Zines are small, self-published booklets and can be about any topic you feel like exploring. They have a history in activism and can be used to spread ideas and art. You could share [photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i9YR_qEl7E), drawings, quotes, your favorite recipes, scientific research results - anything goes. I first saw zine making recommended on YouTube and then learned more about them on [the reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/zines/top/?t=all) (which is great for inspiration!).

# My step-by-step progress
The first step in the progress of creating my travel zines was to travel. I went to Peru and Bolivia for a month-long trip. I had not heard of zines, but after halfway through my trip I met Nina from the Netherlands who told me about an app called [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/). In the app, you can track the locations you travel to and upload photos and text for each destination, and share your travels with others. When I was in the Amazon rainforest towards the end of my journey with no cell reception and only a copy of "King Lear" and around 20 former IDF soldiers to keep me company, I decided to start writing down the many events that had occured during my trip on the notes app of my phone. The text I wrote there covered the first three zines.

Once I had internet again, I started uploading the text on Polarsteps and shared the link with my family. To not worry them about my personal safety I held off on publishing anything relating to landslides until I was back home. There I finished writing about the rest of my trip. As Polarsteps is more focussed on images and locations, its interface wasn't great for large amounts of text, and nobody, apart from one colleague of mine, ended up reading my reports. Around this time I learned of the concept of a zine and decided to try making one myself. My main inspiration came from the [zinemaking subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/zines/top/?t=all), more specifically [Frogs Teeth Field Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/zines/comments/x80p5f/was_told_i_should_post_here/). I split the travel report into five parts and got started. Over time, I settled into making one zine per week and established the following workflow:

**1 - Edit the text**. When I started making the zines, I had already written all the text, I only did minor adjustments.

**2 - Design a draft.** I made rough mockups by stacking four or five sheets of paper and folding them down the middle. Then I looked through the text and noted down ideas on what to draw. Rough sketches on my mockup then served as the basis for my layout. On the back of each mockup, I drew a smaller version of each page to check off as I made the drawings for them.

**3 - Draw the sketches.** I watched [a YouTube tutorial on architectural ink sketches](https://youtu.be/wrqMrGK1wl0?si=fd3tj08D0tGUsM_C) and leaned into the style taught in the video. I mostly used a [MUJI 0.5mm black ink pen](https://germany.muji.eu/products/coloured-gel-pen-with-cap-single-0-5-mm-11046). In a few sketches experimented with Japanese calligraphy pens my dad had gifted me.

**4 - Digitise the sketches.** I used the "Scan Document" function of the Files app of my iPhone and turned the resulting PDFs into images using [PDF24](https://www.pdf24.org/de/). As I often had multiple images per page, I saved each drawing as its own file using the Windows photo editor. Using [the open-source drawing program Krita](https://krita.org/en/) I removed paper textures by opening the curves menu using CTRL+L and then moving the right slider to the left to move all bright graytones to white.

**5 - Layout.** I used [the open-source layouting program Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/). I configured the document to be DIN A5 and set up guides for the margins. I covered all pages in textboxes and linked them to each other. Then I inserted the image frames and selected Properties -> Shape -> "wrap text around image". For some images, I additionally edited the frame shape through inserting and moving additional nodes.

**6 - Details.** I wrote an about and "what happened so far" section for each zine and came up with a title.

**7 - Export the PDF.** Initially I directly exported the PDF from Scribus, but for inexplicable reasons this lead to one of the seals on page 5 to be decapitated, and for some text to disappear. I found out that by exporting the file as images and then assembling them using PDF24 I could keep on the head of the seal. For assembling the pages a peculiar order is needed, so I used my paper mockup for help. E.g. for a four page zine the page order is 16, 1, 2, 15, 14, 3, 4, 13, 12, 5, 6, 11, 10, 7, 8, 9. 

**8 - Paper.** To achieve an aged look of the paper I required bad coffee and good weather. I covered our outside table in coffee, put down the pages, and then brushed more coffee on top with a painter's brush. The sunlight dried them out. When the wind picked up the pages and let them dance through the air I knew they were ready to harvest. To prepare for printing, I ironed the pages flat.

**9 - Print.** Insert 4-6 sheets of aged paper and print at 100% scale, 2 pages per sheet, flip on short side. The time it takes to print a page is perfect for folding the previous page.

**10 - Bind.** I marked the center fold with a pencil, clipped the pages together, and sewed them into a booklet using a 4.5mm stitch length on my sewing machine. To minimize tangled threads, don't cut the thread in between zines. I also wrote the number of the copy in the front.

**11 - Distribute.**

Over the duration of creating the five zines, I've found what worked well for me and what didn't. Initially I considered creating collages from my travel photos and sending the PDF files of the finished zines off to be professionally printed, since I don't have a color printer. After noticing how many photos didn't capture exactly the mood or idea of what I was trying to communicate, I started drawing my own images and ended up doing that throughout. Once I had the first PDF ready for printing I wanted to use the idea from [Frogs Teeth Field Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/zines/comments/x80p5f/was_told_i_should_post_here/) to print on some brown eco paper. None of the professional printers offered that, and since the PDF was black and white anyways I decided to just print on our home printer, with pages that I stained using tea and later coffee.

# Next Steps
I can imagine making zines about future trips, though I like to keep open my options. Also I was considering making zines about concepts, such as my digital garden. I also enjoyed drawing the small comic at the end of zine 1, maybe I'll do more of that. Overall, I hope to continue making zines and would love to see if you also give it a try!
